# SIEM-Internship-Phase-1
**Objective**: Build your own lab environment, understand log sources, and implements basic detection use cases using real tools. 

**Phase Goals**
•	Set up a personal cybersecurity lab (your virtual SOC).
•	Configure log generation, forwarding, and collection. 
•	Detect and respond to basic brute-force and login anomalies and some other 

**Step 1: Setup Our Lab Environment**
1. **Attacking Machine:** Install VMware with kali linux the kali is the attack machine
2. **Target Machine:** Ubuntu is Target Machine for logs collection
3. **SIEM:** Wazuh For Monitors logs, file integrity, rootkits, and system calls.
   Detects malware, unauthorized access, and suspicious behavior.
5. **Monitoring Add-Ons:** AuditD and NXLog Tools

-> We Download and install All Machines and Tools. Then Configure The Wazuh and Add Endpoint is Ubuntu With Monirotoing Tools AuditD and NXLog. Here we detailed Explaind in **SIEM-LAB-SETUP File** This File You Can Find the **Phase1-Tasks Folder** that How To Install, Steup and Configure the SIEM Lab Setup. Go Through The File and Setup Lab. 

**What Is A SIEM and Why it Matters?**
SIEM stands for Security Information and Event Management. It refers to a set of technologies and practices used by organizations to monitor, detect, analyze, and respond to security events across their IT infrastructure. A SIEM system provides a centralized platform that collects, normalizes, and analyzes data from various sources to help security teams detect malicious activity, ensure compliance, and improve overall security posture.
-> You Can Find a Detailed Documentation in the **Phase1-Tasks** Folder the file is **What-Is-SIEM** in this file explained detailed what is siem and why it is matters.
